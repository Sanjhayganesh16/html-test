    A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, 
    seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.

    Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while Fran√ßois Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the 
    first internal combustion engine powered by hydrogen in 1808.
